        <p>
          System Testing is a level of the software testing where a complete
          and integrated software is tested to ensure it meets the given
          requirements. The purpose of this test is to evaluate the systemâ€™s
          compliance with the specified requirements.
        </p>

        <p>
          It may include tests based on risks or requirement specifications,
          business process, use cases, or other high level descriptions of
          system behavior, interactions with the operating systems, and system
          resources.
        </p>

        <p>
          System testing takes place after intergration testing and is commonly
          the final testing stage to ensure the system meets the required
          standards.

      <div class="section-content section-text-normal">
        <p>
          Component testing is running tests on modules of code which are
          testable in isolation without integrating other components.
        </p>

        <p>
          This method makes use of stubs and drivers. These simulate the missing
          modules which the currenlty tested component normally interacts with.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Stub</b>: When a section of code requires input from a currently
          missing component a stub is used to simulate the missing input so
          that the current component may be tested.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Driver</b>: When the code to be tested is used within currenly
          missing components a driver is used to simulate the current comonents
          as they would be used.
        </p>

        <p>
          Integration testing is a level of software testing where individual
          units are combined and tested as a group. This is done to identify
          issues in the interactions between multiple units.
        </p>

        <p>
          Integration tests are done after unit tests but before system tests.
          It may be done with the black box, white box or grey box testing
          methods.

      <div class="section-content section-text-normal">
        <p>
          Unit testing is a level of software testing in which individual units
          are tested in order to validate that each section works as expected.
          A unit is the smallest part of a system, normally has only a few
          inputs and a single output.
        </p>

        <p>
          Unit testing is the first form of testing that normally takes place
          on a system and is performed prior to intergration testing. It uses
          the white box testing method as the person who writes the tests are
          normally aware of the interal working of the system.
        </p>

        <p>
          Unit testing frameworks, drivers, stubs, and mock/ fake objects are
          used to assist in unit testing.
        </p>

        <p>
          In procedural programming a unit may be an individual program,
          function, procedure, etc.In object oriented programming the smallest
          unit of a program is a method which will belong to some form of class.
        </p>

        <h3>Benifits</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Increase confidence to change, refactor and maintain code</li>
          <li>
            Increases development speed by allowing methods to be tested early
            in the process, which increases the number of bugs caught early.
          </li>
          <li>
            Debugging is easy as when tests fail it is highly likely a recent
            change is the issue
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Considerations</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Does not prove absence of errors</li>
          <li>
            If initial tests are not correct their accuracy cannot be guaranteed
          </li>
        </ul>

      <div class="section-content section-text-normal">
        <p>
          White box testing (clear box testing, glass box testing, transparent
          box testing, structural testing) looks at the software been tested and
          uses the knowledge as part to the test. White-box testing requires
          internal knowledge of the system and programming skills. It is useful
          as it provides an internal perspective of the software under test.
        </p>

        <h3>Advantages</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Efficient in finding errors and problems</li>
          <li>Knowledge of internals is beneficial for thorough testing</li>
          <li>Allows finding hidden errors</li>
          <li>Programmers introspection</li>
          <li>Helps optimizing the code</li>
          <li>Due to required internal knowledge of the software, maximum coverage is obtained</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Disadvantages</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Might not find unimplemented or missing features</li>
          <li>Requires high level knowledge of internals of the software under test</li>

      <div class="section-content section-text-normal">
        <p>
          Black box testing (functional testing) is a method by which software
          is tested without its internals being known. The tests use the
          software interfaces and try to ensure they work as expected. The
          tester will be aware of how the software should function but know the
          processes which result in the functionality.
        </p>

        <h3>Advantages</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Efficient for large segments of code</li>
          <li>Code access is not required</li>
          <li>Separation between userâ€™s and developerâ€™s perspectives</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Disadvantages</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Limited coverage since only a fraction of test scenarios is performed</li>
          <li>Inefficient testing due to testerâ€™s luck of knowledge about software internals</li>
          <li>Blind coverage since tester has limited knowledge about the application</li>

          Dynamic testing is the opposite of static testing and involves testing
          code by running it, providing input and comparing the result against
          the expected value. Types of dynamic testing include unit testing,
          integration testing, system testing and acceptance testing.

        <p>
          Static testing (the opposite of dynamic testing) is a software testing
          method which involves testing the software without running the actual
          program. Static testing may conducted manually or with the aid of
          software and may include code analysis, inspection, code reviews and
          walkthroughs.
        </p>

        <p>
          Errors found using this method may include undefined variables, unused
          code, unreachable code, security vulnerabilities, standards violations
          or syntax violations.

          A thorough test should consider normal, extreme and exceptional data.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Normal</b>: data that you would expect to work</li>
          <li><b>Extreme</b>: data at the lower and upper ranges of acceptance</li>

          <li>
            <b>Run-time error</b>: Errors caused by invalid values or processes
            that take place while the code is running (for example dividing by

        <p>
          In the Iterative model a small set of software requirements are
          identified, implemented and tested. The product is then reviewed,
          further requirements are identified, development begins again and tests
          are repeated and extended. This process is repeated with a new version
          of the software being produced and the end of each iteration.
        </p>

        <p>
          The basic idea behind this model is to produce a product through
          repeated cycles within small portions of time. It is a combination of
          iterative design and incremental building.
        </p>

        <h3>Stages</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Planning and Requirements</li>
          <li>Analysis and Design</li>
          <li>Implementation</li>
          <li>Testing</li>
          <li>Evaluation</li>
          <li>Repeat</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>When to use</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Requirements of the complete system are clearly understood</li>
          <li>The project is large and can be broken into smaller increments</li>
          <li>
            At least the major requirements are understood and defined (some
            functionalities may evolve or be decided on later)
          </li>
          <li>Useful when there is a to market constraint</li>
          <li>
            A new technology is being used and learnt by the development team
          </li>
          <li>
            Specific skills are required but not available and will contracted
            for specific iterations
          </li>
          <li>There are high risk features and goals may be changed</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Advantages</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            A working model of the system is available during early development.
            This makes identifying issues early easier.
          </li>
          <li>Operational product is available with each increment</li>
          <li>
            Able to present incomplete iterations of product to customer for
            review and feedback
          </li>
          <li>
            Some functionality can be developed quickly and early in the
            life cycle.
          </li>
          <li>Versioning of a system is easy</li>
          <li>Parallel development is possible</li>
          <li>Progress can be measured</li>
          <li>Cheap to change minor details in scope or requirements</li>
          <li>Testing and debugging during small iterations is easy</li>
          <li>Easy to manage risk</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Disadvantages</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>May require more resources</li>
          <li>
            While changing requirements is cheap it is not suited to large
            changes
          </li>
          <li>
            Possible design issues as not all requirements are decided on
            at the beginning of the life cycle
          </li>
          <li>
            Not suitable for small projects
          </li>
          <li>More Management attention is required</li>
          <li>End of project may not be known</li>
          <li>Project progress is dependent on analysis phase</li>
          <li>Highly skilled resources are required for risk analysis</li>
          <li>
            Promotes feature creep and repeated requests for further development
          </li>
        </ul>

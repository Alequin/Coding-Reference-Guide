        <p>
          This model, also known as the linear-sequential life cycle model, was
          the first process to be used. It this model each stage cascades into
          the next and does not take place until the previous is complete.

        <ul>

          <li>
            <b>Requirement Analysis</b>: System requirements are decided on and
            documented
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>System Design</b>: The requirements are studied and the system
            design is prepared using them as a guide. The design phase defines
            the software architecture to be used and the hardware requirements.
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Implementation</b>: Using the design the system is developed in
            small programs called units. Each unit us developed and tested,
            which is known as unit testing.
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Testing and Integration</b>: The units are integrated into a
            system and the result is tested for faults and failures.
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Deployment</b>: Once testing is done the product is released.
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Maintenance</b>: Once released the product may be patched or
            enhanced.
          </li>

        </ul>

        <h3>When to use</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Requirements are very well documented, clear and fixed.</li>
          <li>Product definition is stable.</li>
          <li>Technology is understood and is not dynamic.</li>
          <li>There are no ambiguous requirements.</li>
          <li>
            Ample resources with required expertise are available to support
            the product.
          </li>
          <li>The project is short.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Advantages</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Easy to schedule deadlines for stages</li>
          <li>Easy to use and understand</li>
          <li>Easy to manage</li>
          <li>Works well for small projects with well defined requirements</li>
          <li>Easy to arrange tasks</li>
          <li>Easy to produce technical documentation</li>
          <li>Easy to estimate production costs</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Disadvantages</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Difficult to re-engineer if results are not as expected</li>
          <li>Little opportunity for reflection and revision</li>
          <li>No production until the late stages of the life cycle</li>
          <li>High risk</li>
          <li>Poor model for complex and OOP projects</li>
          <li>Poor model for long projects</li>
          <li>Little opportunity to update or change requirments</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="section-content section-text-normal">
        <p>
          The Software Development Life Cycle (sdlc) or software development
          process describes the distinct work phases and methods used to plan,
          design, develop and test software.
        </p>

        <p>
          The sdlc is a process used by those who create software to plan, develop
          maintain, replace, alter and enhance software. Common stages of a
          sdlc might include...
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Planning</b>: Planning (or requirement analysis) is the most
            important stage. Input for multiple sources is used to outline the
            basic project approach and conduct product feasibility studies.
            Plans should also consider the quality assurance requirements and
            identify possible risks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Defining</b>: Projects requirements must be clearly defined and
            documented in a <b>software requirement specification</b> (SRS)
            document.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Designing</b>: Using the SRS the product architecture is defined.
            More than one approach may be proposed and documented in a
            <b>Designing Document Specification</b> (DDS).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Building</b>: In this stage the product is built.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Testing</b>: The product is tested for defects and bugs and
            fixed until it reaches the desired quality. This stage is commonly
            a subset within other stages is most modern sdlc models.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Deployment</b>: Once complete the product is released
          </li>
        </ul>

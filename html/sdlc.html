        <p>
          In the Iterative model a small set of software requirements are
          identified, implemented and tested. The product is then reviewed,
          further requirements are identified, development begins again and tests
          are repeated and extended. This process is repeated with a new version
          of the software being produced and the end of each iteration.
        </p>

        <p>
          The basic idea behind this model is to produce a product through
          repeated cycles within small portions of time. It is a combination of
          iterative design and incremental building.
        </p>

        <h3>Stages</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Planning and Requirements</li>
          <li>Analysis and Design</li>
          <li>Implementation</li>
          <li>Testing</li>
          <li>Evaluation</li>
          <li>Repeat</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>When to use</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Requirements of the complete system are clearly understood</li>
          <li>The project is large and can be broken into smaller increments</li>
          <li>
            At least the major requirements are understood and defined (some
            functionalities may evolve or be decided on later)
          </li>
          <li>Useful when there is a to market constraint</li>
          <li>
            A new technology is being used and learnt by the development team
          </li>
          <li>
            Specific skills are required but not available and will contracted
            for specific iterations
          </li>
          <li>There are high risk features and goals may be changed</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Advantages</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            A working model of the system is available during early development.
            This makes identifying issues early easier.
          </li>
          <li>Operational product is available with each increment</li>
          <li>
            Able to present incomplete iterations of product to customer for
            review and feedback
          </li>
          <li>
            Some functionality can be developed quickly and early in the
            life cycle.
          </li>
          <li>Versioning of a system is easy</li>
          <li>Parallel development is possible</li>
          <li>Progress can be measured</li>
          <li>Cheap to change minor details in scope or requirements</li>
          <li>Testing and debugging during small iterations is easy</li>
          <li>Easy to manage risk</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Disadvantages</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>May require more resources</li>
          <li>
            While changing requirements is cheap it is not suited to large
            changes
          </li>
          <li>
            Possible design issues as not all requirements are decided on
            at the beginning of the life cycle
          </li>
          <li>
            Not suitable for small projects
          </li>
          <li>More Management attention is required</li>
          <li>End of project may not be known</li>
          <li>Project progress is dependent on analysis phase</li>
          <li>Highly skilled resources are required for risk analysis</li>
          <li>
            Promotes feature creep and repeated requests for further development
          </li>
        </ul>

          This model, also known as the linear-sequential life cycle model, was
          the first process to be used. It this model each stage cascades into
          the next and does not take place until the previous is complete.
        </p>

        <img src="../examples/sdlc/waterfall.jpg" alt="">

        <ul>

          <li>
            <b>Requirement Analysis</b>: System requirements are decided on and
            documented
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>System Design</b>: The requirements are studied and the system
            design is prepared using them as a guide. The design phase defines
            the software architecture to be used and the hardware requirements.
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Implementation</b>: Using the design the system is developed in
            small programs called units. Each unit us developed and tested,
            which is known as unit testing.
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Testing and Integration</b>: The units are integrated into a
            system and the result is tested for faults and failures.
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Deployment</b>: Once testing is done the product is released.
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Maintenance</b>: Once released the product may be patched or
            enhanced.
          </li>

        </ul>

        <h3>When to use</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Requirements are very well documented, clear and fixed.</li>
          <li>Product definition is stable.</li>
          <li>Technology is understood and is not dynamic.</li>
          <li>There are no ambiguous requirements.</li>
          <li>
            Ample resources with required expertise are available to support
            the product.
          </li>
          <li>The project is short.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Advantages</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Easy to schedule deadlines for stages</li>
          <li>Easy to use and understand</li>
          <li>Easy to manage</li>
          <li>Works well for small projects with well defined requirements</li>
          <li>Easy to arrange tasks</li>
          <li>Easy to produce technical documentation</li>
          <li>Easy to estimate production costs</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Disadvantages</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Difficult to re-engineer if results are not as expected</li>
          <li>Little opportunity for reflection and revision</li>
          <li>No production until the late stages of the life cycle</li>
          <li>High risk</li>
          <li>Poor model for complex and OOP projects</li>
          <li>Poor model for long projects</li>
          <li>Little opportunity to update or change requirments</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="section-content section-text-normal">
        <p>
          The Software Development Life Cycle (sdlc) or software development
          process describes the distinct work phases and methods used to plan,
          design, develop and test software.
        </p>

        <p>
          The sdlc is a process used by those who create software to plan, develop
          maintain, replace, alter and enhance software. Common stages of the
          sdlc include...
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Planning</b>: Planning (or requirement analysis) is the most
            important stage. Input from multiple sources is used to outline the
            requirements of the desired system, required resources, costs and
            overall production time. Plans should also consider the quality
            assurance requirements and identify possible risks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Defining</b>: Projects requirements must be clearly defined and
            documented in a <b>software requirement specification</b> (SRS)
            document.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Analysis and Design</b>: Using the SRS high level designs of
            the system are produced. The overall architecture is planned and
            the technologies to be used are selected. Time constraints and cost
            are reviewed and the best design approach is selected.
            <br><br>
            The architectural design defines all the components that need to
            be developed, use of third party services, database connections,
            front end design and behaviour and system use cases.
            <br><br>
            More than one approach may be proposed and documented in a
            <b>Designing Document Specification</b> (DDS).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Development</b>: In this stage the product is built. This phase
            marks the start of production
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Testing</b>: The product is tested for defects and bugs and
            fixed until it reaches the desired quality. This stage is commonly
            a subset within other stages in most modern sdlc models.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Deployment</b>: Once complete the product is released.
          </li>
        </ul>

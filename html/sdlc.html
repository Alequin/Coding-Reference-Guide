          Prototyping to the production of an application which displays a
          systems functionality but does not hold the actual logic. It enables
          the acquisition of valuable feedback at early stages of development.
        </p>

        <p>
          The main purpose of prototypes is to allow customers and users to
          evaluate developer proposals prior to  implementations and to
          gain a better understanding of requirements via feedback.
        </p>

        <h3>Phases of Prototyping</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Basic Requirement Identification</b>: This involves
            understanding the very basic product requirements in terms of user
            interface. Internal design, performance and security may be ignored
            at this stage.
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Developing the Initial Prototype</b>: The initial prototype is
            developed, which showcases the basic requirements and user
            interface. Again the features may not work in the same way as the
            actual software and act as a way to provide the customer a way to
            view the direct the product is taking.
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Review of the Prototype</b>: The developed prototype is presented
            to the customer and feedback is collected.
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Revise and Enhance Prototype</b>: In this phase the feedback is
            discussed and negotiations take place with the customer.
          </li>
        </ul>


        <h3>When to use</h3>
          <li>
            When the desired system needs to have lots of interaction with the
            end users (online systems, web interfaces ect...).
            <br><br>
            This ensures constant feedback, which will be incorporated into each
            prototype.
          </li>
        <ul>

        </ul>

        <h3>Advantages</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Users are actively involved in the development</li>
          <li>Errors are detected easily</li>
          <li>Quick and useful feedback</li>
          <li>Able to identify difficult or confusing functionality easily</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Disadvantages</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Leads to implementing and the repairing way of building systems</li>
          <li>
            May increase complexity beyond scope based on feedback and customer
            desires
          </li>
          <li>
            Incomplete applications may result in misuse an incorrect use of
            the system during user testing
          </li>
          <li>Possibility of poor requirement analysis</li>
        </ul>

      <h2 class="section-header">Rapid Application Development</h2>

      <div class="section-content section-text-normal">
        <p>
          The RAD Model is based on prototyping and iterative development
          with little planning, as planning is involved with writing the
          software itself. It focuses on rapid production of prototypes, customer
          testing of prototypes, gathering requirements via workshops or focus
          groups, reuse of prototypes, continuous integration and rapid
          development.
        </p>

        <p>
          RAD makes use of iterative and incremental methods to produce
          functional prototypes of modules and the system. A key requirement
          of this model is that prototypes are resuable.
        </p>

        <h3>Phases of RAD</h3>
        <br>
        <img src="../examples/sdlc/sdlc_rad_model.jpg" alt="">

        <h3>When to use</h3>
          <li>
            When the system can be easily modularised to suit the methods
            incremental nature.
          </li>
          <li>
            When the requirements are likely to change based on customer
            feedback.
          </li>
        <ul>

        </ul>

        <h3>Advantages</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Changing requirements can be accomodated</li>
          <li>progress can be measured</li>
          <li>Iteration can be short thanks to RAD tools</li>
          <li>Reduced development time</li>
          <li>Productive with only a few people</li>
          <li>Able to reuse components</li>
          <li>Useful customer feedback</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Disadvantages</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Results are dependent on a technically stong team who are good at
            identifing business requirements
          </li>
          <li>Only systems tha</li>

      <h2 class="section-header">Agile Model</h2>

      <div class="section-content section-text-normal">
        <p>
          This model is a combination of iterative and incremental process
          models with focus on process adaptability and customer satisfaction by
          rapid delivery. Agile methods break the product into small incremental
          builds, which take place over one to three weeks and involve stages
          of the SDLC such as planning, analysis, design, development and
          testing.
        </p>

        <p>The four key principles of agile development include...</p>

        <ul>

          <li>
            <b>Individuals and Interactions</b>: Self organisation is important
            by so are interactions such as pair programming
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Working Software</b>: Working demos are the best means of
            customer communication
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Customer Collaboration</b>: Continuous customer interaction is
            important to enable the maintenance and development of requirements
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Responding to Change</b>: Agile is focused on quick response to
            change and continuous developments
          </li>

        </ul>

        <p>
          Agile is based on adaptive software development methods, rather than
          predictive methods. Predictive methods require detailed and strict
          planning and a forecast of development over the next few months.
        </p>

        <p>
          There is no detailed planning in adaptive methods. Development is
          feature driven and teams adapt to the changing product dynamically.
          Testing occurs frequently to reduce risk.
        </p>

        <img src="../examples/sdlc/agile_model.jpg" alt="">

        <h3>When to use</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            When Changes to product are common. Frequency of increments makes
            implementing changes cheap as low risk
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Advantages</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Promotes team work</li>
          <li>Rapid development of easily demonstrated functionality</li>
          <li>Low resource requirements</li>
          <li>Easy to change requirements</li>
          <li>Minimal rules, documentation easily employed</li>
          <li>Short planning stages</li>
          <li>Easy to manage</li>
          <li>Gives flexibility to developers</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Disadvantages</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Not suitable for complex dependencies</li>
          <li>Risky in regards to sustainability and maintainability</li>
          <li>
            Will not work without an overall plan, agile leader and agile
            project manager practice
          </li>
          <li>
            Depends on good customer interactions. Unclear communication may lead
            teams in the wrong direction
          </li>
          <li>
            Challenging to include new team members due to limited documentation

        <p>
          The spiral model is a combination between iterative development and
          the controlled aspects of the waterfall model. It has four phases...
        </p>

        <ul>

          <li>
            <b>Identification</b>: The basic requirements are gathered in the
            baseline spiral.
            <br><br>
            In subsequent spirals identification of further
            requirements, subsystem requirements and unit requirements are
            considered. Customer communication is also done in this phase to
            consider their opinion of the current software.
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Design</b>: In the baseline spiral the conceptual design is
            produced.
            <br><br>
            In subsequent spirals the architecture, modules and front end design
            are further considered and enhanced.
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Construct / Build</b>: Here the product undergoes production.
            In the initial spiral a proof of concept (POC) version is produced,
            to enable feedback.
            <br><br>
            In subsequent spirals a working model of the system is produced
            (called build), each with a version number.
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Evaluation / Risk Analysis</b>: Here risk analysis is conducted
            to identify, estimate and monitor the technical feasibility,
            management risks, schedule issues and cost issues.
          </li>

        </ul>

        <h3>When to use</h3>

        <ul>

        <p>
          In the Iterative model a small set of software requirements are
          identified, implemented and tested. The product is then reviewed,
          further requirements are identified, development begins again and tests
          are repeated and extended. This process is repeated with a new version
          of the software being produced and the end of each iteration.
        </p>

        <p>
          The basic idea behind this model is to produce a product through
          repeated cycles within small portions of time. It is a combination of
          iterative design and incremental building.

          <li>Evaluation</li>
          <li>Repeat</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>When to use</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Requirements of the complete system are clearly understood</li>
          <li>The project is large and can be broken into smaller increments</li>
          <li>
            At least the major requirements are understood and defined (some
            functionalities may evolve or be decided on later)
          </li>
          <li>Useful when there is a to market constraint</li>
          <li>
            A new technology is being used and learnt by the development team
          </li>
          <li>
            Specific skills are required but not available and will contracted
            for specific iterations
          </li>
          <li>There are high risk features and goals may be changed</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Advantages</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            A working model of the system is available during early development.
            This makes identifying issues early easier.

          <li>Operational product is available with each increment</li>
          <li>
            Able to present incomplete iterations of product to customer for
            review and feedback
          </li>
          <li>
            Some functionality can be developed quickly and early in the
            life cycle.
          </li>
          <li>Versioning of a system is easy</li>
          <li>Parallel development is possible</li>

          <li>Cheap to change minor details in scope or requirements</li>
          <li>Testing and debugging during small iterations is easy</li>
          <li>Easy to manage risk</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Disadvantages</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>May require more resources</li>
          <li>
            While changing requirements is cheap it is not suited to large
            changes
          </li>
          <li>
            Possible design issues as not all requirements are decided on
            at the beginning of the life cycle
          </li>
          <li>
            Not suitable for small projects
          </li>
          <li>More Management attention is required</li>
          <li>End of project may not be known</li>
          <li>Project progress is dependent on analysis phase</li>
          <li>Highly skilled resources are required for risk analysis</li>
          <li>
            Promotes feature creep and repeated requests for further development

        <p>
          This model, also known as the linear-sequential life cycle model, was
          the first process to be used. It this model each stage cascades into
          the next and does not take place until the previous is complete.

        <ul>

          <li>
            <b>Requirement Analysis</b>: System requirements are decided on and
            documented
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>System Design</b>: The requirements are studied and the system
            design is prepared using them as a guide. The design phase defines
            the software architecture to be used and the hardware requirements.
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Implementation</b>: Using the design the system is developed in
            small programs called units. Each unit us developed and tested,
            which is known as unit testing.
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Testing and Integration</b>: The units are integrated into a
            system and the result is tested for faults and failures.
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Deployment</b>: Once testing is done the product is released.
          </li>

          <li>
            <b>Maintenance</b>: Once released the product may be patched or
            enhanced.
          </li>

        </ul>

        <h3>When to use</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Requirements are very well documented, clear and fixed.</li>
          <li>Product definition is stable.</li>
          <li>Technology is understood and is not dynamic.</li>
          <li>There are no ambiguous requirements.</li>
          <li>
            Ample resources with required expertise are available to support
            the product.
          </li>
          <li>The project is short.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Advantages</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Easy to schedule deadlines for stages</li>
          <li>Easy to use and understand</li>
          <li>Easy to manage</li>
          <li>Works well for small projects with well defined requirements</li>
          <li>Easy to arrange tasks</li>
          <li>Easy to produce technical documentation</li>
          <li>Easy to estimate production costs</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Disadvantages</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Difficult to re-engineer if results are not as expected</li>
          <li>Little opportunity for reflection and revision</li>
          <li>No production until the late stages of the life cycle</li>
          <li>High risk</li>
          <li>Poor model for complex and OOP projects</li>
          <li>Poor model for long projects</li>
          <li>Little opportunity to update or change requirments</li>
        </ul>

      <h2 class="section-header">What is the Software Development Life Cycle</h2>

      <div class="section-content section-text-normal">
        <p>
          The Software Development Life Cycle (sdlc) or software development
          process describes the distinct work phases and methods used to plan,
          design, develop and test software.
        </p>

        <p>
          The sdlc is a process used by those who create software to plan, develop
          maintain, replace, alter and enhance software. Common stages of the
          sdlc include...
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Planning</b>: Planning (or requirement analysis) is the most
            important stage. Input from multiple sources is used to outline the
            requirements of the desired system, required resources, costs and
            overall production time. Plans should also consider the quality
            assurance requirements and identify possible risks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Defining</b>: Projects requirements must be clearly defined and
            documented in a <b>software requirement specification</b> (SRS)
            document.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Analysis and Design</b>: Using the SRS high level designs of
            the system are produced. The overall architecture is planned and
            the technologies to be used are selected. Time constraints and cost
            are reviewed and the best design approach is selected.
            <br><br>
            The architectural design defines all the components that need to
            be developed, use of third party services, database connections,
            front end design and behaviour and system use cases.
            <br><br>
            More than one approach may be proposed and documented in a
            <b>Designing Document Specification</b> (DDS).
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Development</b>: In this stage the product is built. This phase
            marks the start of production
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Testing</b>: The product is tested for defects and bugs and
            fixed until it reaches the desired quality. This stage is commonly
            a subset within other stages in most modern sdlc models.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Deployment</b>: Once complete the product is released.
          </li>
        </ul>

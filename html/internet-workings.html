      <div class="section-content section-text-normal">

        <p>A <strong>URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)</strong> is an umbrella term which includes <strong>URL’s (Uniform Resource Locator)</strong> and <strong>URN’s (Uniform Resource Name)</strong>. </p>

        <p>A <strong>URN</strong> is a method of locating resources on the web using a globally unique name. As the name is unique its location is not required to access the resource. The identifier of a resource is assigned within a defined namespace to ensure the uniqueness of the given name.</p>

        <p>A <strong>URL</strong> is the human readable address of a resource on the internet that includes the protocol used to access the data. While there are a number of possible protocols the commonly used ones are http:// and https://.</p>

        <p><strong>URL’s </strong>consists of an access protocol, the domain name and a path to the directory on the server.</p> 

        <p>
          <strong>https://github.com/Alequin/Programming-Reference-Guide
          <br><br>
          Access protocol: http://<br>
          Domain name: www.github.com<br>
          Directory path: /Alequin/Programming-Reference-Guide
          </strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          Additionally a <strong>URL</strong> might include a <strong>query string </strong>or a <strong>fragment</strong>
          <br><br>
          A <strong>query string</strong> is used to pass a string to a program that runs when the site is requested. The start of the sting is defined by a question mark symbol (?). 
          <br><br>
          <strong>
            http://example.com/over/there?name=ferret
          </strong>
          <br><br>
          A <strong>fragment</strong> is used to link to a location within the page. A hash symbol (#) followed by the ID of an element is a <strong>fragment</strong> and when used will place the top of the named element will be placed at the top of the screen. A good example of these can be seen on all the <strong>URL's</strong> produced by a  google search

      <div class="section-content section-text-normal">
        <p>
          All machines (wether they are nodes or end points) have an <strong>IP address</strong>. This unique value identifies each machine on the network. While most machines use a version of <strong>IP</strong> known as <strong>IPV4</strong> the number of addresses using this system are running out. <strong>IPV4</strong> uses four 32-bit decimal integers ranging from 0 – 255. This can produce 2<sup>32</sup> possible addresses. <strong>IPV6</strong> is the most recent version which uses eight 128-bit hexadecimal integers ranging from 0 - FFFF (0 - 65535), which allows for 2<sup>128</sup> possible addresses, and while adoption of this system is being encouraged there are compatibility issues between the two. As most of the internet is based on <strong>IVP4</strong> many are employing techniques to prolong the life of <strong>IVP4</strong> rather than switching to <strong>IVP6</strong>. 
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>IVP4 addresses</strong>: 2<sup>32</sup> = 4,294,967,296<br>
          <strong>IVP6 addresses</strong>: 2<sup>128</sup> = 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 <br>
        </p>

        <p>
        <em>Note: While the large numbers above do represent the number of possible addresses using both systems this does not represent the true number of useable addresses as many are reserved. For example a valid <strong>IVP6</strong> address must start with a number containing four digits and beginning with a 2 or 3.</em>
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt><strong>IVP4</strong></dd>
          <dd><strong>69.89.31.226</strong></dd>
          <dd>
            A single number in the address is known as an <strong>octet</strong> and each one is separated by a dot. The numbers are presented to humans in decimal format but the computer converts them into 8-bit binary numbers.
          </dd>
        </dl>

        <dl>
          <dt><strong>IVP6</strong></dd>
          <dd><strong>2002:4559:1FE2:0:0:0:4559:1FE2</strong></dd>
          <dd>
            A single number in the address is known as an <strong>hexlet</strong> and each one is separated by a colon. The numbers are presented to humans in hexadecimal format but the computer converts them into 16-bit binary numbers. 
            <br><br>
            The Three zero's in this address can be removed to save character. They are replaced with two colon's to produce 2002:4559:1FE2::4559:1FE2.

      <div class="section-content section-text-normal">

        <p>
          The internet is supported by a number of different types of hardware such as routers, servers, cell phone towers, satellites, radios, and other devices.
        </p>

        <p>
          These elements are connections. Some are end points such as the clients machine, where requests are made, and others may be servers, which respond to client requests and return data. The other elements are nodes which direct connections between the endpoints. All these elements are connected by transmission lines such as cables or wireless signals from satellites, towers or radios.
        </p>

        <p>
          To ensure the correct machines are communicating with one another protocols are used to define how machines connect and transfer data. The two most important protocols are <strong>TCP (transmission control protocol)</strong> and I<strong>P (internet protocol)</strong>. They are commonly seen grouped and referred to as <strong>TCP/IP</strong> . Without these protocol two computers would not be able to transfer data without a direct connection and a common language shared between both computers. <strong>IP addresses</strong> are provided by <strong>DHCP’s (dynamic host configuration protocol)</strong>, which dynamically assign addresses and ensures your computer is correctly configured to work on the network. 
        </p>

        <p>
          When clients make requests the <strong>TCP/IP</strong> protocols are used. The request is sent to your <strong>ISP (internet service provider)</strong>, which routes the request to other servers and eventually to a <strong>DNS (domain name server)</strong>. The role of the <strong>DNS</strong> is to use the given domain name to find the <strong>IP address</strong> of the target server (this is known as name resolution). If a matching <strong>IP address</strong> is found the connection is directed to the target server, otherwise the request is sent to another <strong>DNS</strong> until a match is found.
        </p> 

        <p>
          <em>Note: The <strong>DNS</strong> can be bypassed if a valid <strong>IP address</strong> is provided instead of a domain name.</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          When the server receives a request it responds by sending <strong>packets</strong> of data commonly ranging in size from 1kb – 1.5kbs though they can be 9kb (size depends on the hardware used and the IP version in use). These <strong>packets</strong> contain the information that is to be returned to the client. Multiple <strong>packets</strong> relating to the same response may take different paths in order to avoid congested routes and increase the overall transmission speed.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>packets</strong> use headers and footers to describe their contents and how the data they hold fits with the data from other <strong>packets</strong>. They will take the path of least resistance back to the client in order to avoid congested routes. Multiple <strong>packets</strong> relating to the same response may take different paths.
        </p>  

        <p>
          When the client has received the <strong>packets</strong> the instructions in the header/footer and the protocols are used to assemble them into a complete document.

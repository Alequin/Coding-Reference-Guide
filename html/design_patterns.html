      <h2 class="section-header">Decorator Pattern</h2>

      <div class="section-content section-text-normal">
        <p>
          The purpose of the Decorator pattern (or Wrapper pattern) is to attach
          additional responsibilities and functionality to objects dynamically.
          It is an alternative to using inheritance and subclassing. The
          decorator patten uses composition composition.
        </p>

        <p>
          Composition is the idea of objects containing references to instances
          of others which contain desirable functionality. The decoration
          features which make the pattern possible (reference to desirable
          object(s) or required methods) are normally defined in a separate
          inheritable section of code (interfaces, mixin).
        </p>

        <p>
          The following file is a very basic example of the decorator patterns
          using pizza.
        </p>

        <a href="../examples/ruby/pizza_decorator/pizza_decorator.rb">
          <p>
            pizza-decorator.rb
          </p>
        </a>

        <p>
          In the given example the class <b>PizzaBase</b> is decorated by
          <b>Sweetcorn</b> and <b>Chorizo</b>. While Sweetcorn and Chorizo could
          have been written without inheriting from another class it ensures
          the correct features are included. The reference to the object to be
          decorated is created in the Toppings class <b>(@pizza)</b> and meaning
          that all classes that inherit from Topping are able to wrap an object.
        </p>

        <p>
          This can be seen in the final method
          <b>get_stonebake_with_sweetcorn_chorizo</b> as the pizza base is
          wrapped by sweetcorn, which is then wrapped by chorizo.
        </p>

      <h2 class="section-header">Observer Pattern</h2>

      <div class="section-content section-text-normal">
        <p>
          The <b>observer pattern</b> is used when a state change in a single
          object (the <b>subject</b>) influences multiple other object
          (<b>observers</b>). <b>Observers</b> can be added and removed from
          the list of objects which the <b>subject</b> updates on its state
          change.
        </p>

        <p>
          A real world example of this is newspaper subscribers. The newspaper
          publisher is the subject and subscribers are the observers. If a
          person is subscribed to the paper they will receive a new copy when it
          is available. If someone wanted to start receiving updates from the
          publisher they can subscribe, which would make them an observer.
          Subscribers may also leave the paper. This would mean they no longer
          receive updated copies and are no longer observers.
        </p>

        <p>
          The following code is an example of the observer pattern in ruby.
        </p>

        <a href="../examples/ruby/observer.rb">Observer pattern in Ruby</a>

        <p>
          In this situation the subject is a playing card dealer and the
          observers are players at the dealers table. When a player sits at the
          table they become an observer and receive updates about the dealers
          game. When the players leave the table they are no longer observers
          and won't receive any updates.

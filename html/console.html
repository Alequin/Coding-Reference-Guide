        <dd>

          <dt><b>man pwd</b></dt>
          <dt><b>man clear</b></dt>
          <dd>
            This command stands for <b>manual</b> and is used to show the
            documentation on a command inside the terminal.
          </dd>
          <br>
          <dt><b>.</b></dt>
          <dt><b>..</b></dt>
          <dd>
            The dot character represents the current directory and can be used
            with a number of commands. Two dots represents the parent directory.
          </dd>
          <dt><b>*</b></dt>
          <dt><b>*.jpg</b></dt>
          <dd>
            The asterisk character is used as a wildcard and is used with
            commands in place of a file and directory name. Alone it represents
            all files and child directories in the current directory but it may
            be combine with other characters to match specific files, as shown
            in the examples.
            <br><br>
            The asterisk character actually represents any number of characters.
            Alone it matches to any file name that has any characters in it
            (which is all file names).
          </dd>
          <br>
          <dt><b>pwd</b></dt>
          <dd>
            This command stands for <b>print working directory</b> and is used
            to print the full path to the current directory.
          </dd>
          <br>
          <dt><b>clear</b></dt>
          <dd>
            This command is used to clear the terminal of all text of previous
            commands and outputs.
          </dd>
          <br>
          <dt><b>ls</b></dt>
          <dt><b>ls -a</b></dt>
          <dt><b>ls directory-name</b></dt>
          <dd>
            This command stands for <b>list</b> and is used to list the contents of
            the current working directory (except for those that start with a
            dot, which are hidden files). To truly show all files the options
            <b>-a</b> can be applied. If ls is given the name of a valid child
            directory it will list the contents of that child directory.
          </dd>
          <br>
          <dt><b>cd dir-to-access</b></dt>
          <dt><b>cd dir-to-access/another-dir-to-access</b></dt>
          <dt><b>cd ..</b></dt>
          <dt><b>cd ../../..</b></dt>
          <dt><b>cd ....</b></dt>
          <dd>
            This command stands for <b>change directory</b> and is used to move
            between directories. The target directory must be within the current
            working directory. The name of the target should be placed after the
            command <b>cd</b>.
            <br><br>
            The use of double dots will move to the parent directory of the
            current one and multiple sets of dots may be used to move outwards
            multiple times. The last two examples are equivelent and move
            to the parent directory three times.
          </dd>
          <br>
          <dt><b>mkdir new-directory</b></dt>
          <dt><b>mkdir new-directory/new-inner-directory</b></dt>
          <dd>
            This command stands for <b>make directory</b> and is used to create
            new directories. The new directory is created in the current working
            directory. If a path is used to create a directory all but the last
            directory (the one to be created) should already exist.
          </dd>
          <br>
          <dt><b>cp file-to-copy name-of-copy</b></dt>
          <dt><b>cp file-to-copy ../name-of-copy</b></dt>
          <dt><b>cp file-to-copy other-dir/name-of-copy</b></dt>
          <dt><b>cp -R directory-to-copy name-of-copy</b></dt>
          <dd>
            This command stands for <b>copy</b> and is used to make a copy of
            a file. The first file given is the path to the file to be copied.
            The second is the path to the location where a copy should be made.
            <br><br>
            To copy a directory the option <b>-R</b> must be used as shown in
            the last example.
          </dd>
          <br>
          <dt><b>mv file-to-move new-file-name</b></dt>
          <dt><b>mv file-to-move new-location/file-to-move</b></dt>
          <dt><b>mv file-to-move new-location/new-file-name</b></dt>
          <dd>
            This command stands for <b>move</b> and is used to move files from
            one location to another or rename files. In the first example the
            file will simply be renamed, in the second it will be moved into
            the new location with the same name. In the third it will be moved
            and renamed.
          </dd>
          <br>
          <dt><b>rm file-to-delete</b></dt>
          <dt><b>rm -i file-to-delete</b></dt>
          <dt><b>rm -d file-to-delete</b></dt>
          <dt><b>rm -R directory-to-delete</b></dt>
          <dt><b>rm -iR directory-to-delete</b></dt>
          <dd>
            This command stands for <b>remove</b> and is used to remove / delete
            files. If you want to confirm the deletion the option <b>-i</b> can
            be used. This will not work on directories unless the option <b>-R</b>
            is used. This is also used to force the deletion of non-empty
            directories.
            <br><br>
            The options i and R can be used together <b>(-iR)</b> to recusivly
            move through the files in the target directory and decide if each
            one should be deleted.
          </dd>
          <br>
          <dt><b>rmdir directory-to-delete</b></dt>
          <dd>
            This command stands for <b>remove directory</b> and is used to
            remove / delete directories. This will not work on files and cannot
            be used to force delete directories. To force deletion use
            <b>rm -d name</b>.
          </dd>
          <br>

      <div class="section-content section-text-normal">
        <p>
          <b>UNIX</b> is an operating system first developed in 1969 and first
          published in 1971. UNIX systems provides a simple set of tools which
          perform simple and well defined functions within a unified file system.
          They also use shell scripting to combine tools to perform complex
          actions.
        </p>

        <p>
          UNIX operating systems are made up of three parts...
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>The Kernal</b>: This is the central component of the operating
          system and performs multiple functions. Some of the subsystems of the
          kernal include process management, scheduling, file management,
          device management, network management, memory management and device
          interupt managment.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>The Shell</b>: This is an interface between user and kernal which
          presents as a <b>CLI (command line interpreter)</b>. The user inputs
          commands and the shell starts the associated program. Once the program
          has run the CLI prompt the user for more input.
        </p>

        <p><b>Processes and Programs</b></p>: The final part is the processes
        and programs that run to carry out actions on the system. Each
        excecuting program is given a unique <b>PID (process identifier)</b>
